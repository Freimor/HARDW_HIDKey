## HID Key
A HID device for loadout system with a setup script. Made for the OPS team of School 21. This device allows to easily set up new workstations with just one keychain-like device. Before that the team used Arduino Micro with a bulky case and a usb cable. That device connects to MAC via Type-C, it is protected from electrostatic discharge, has an additional programmable button, an RGB LED and is very small in size.
The project is completed in Q3 2021.
